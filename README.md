The following are the requirements from the Rithm School pre work:

At a minimum, your personal website should have the following:

1. Some sort of navigation (a navbar at the top of each page, for instance).
2. The following three sections, either as separate pages or as sections in a longer single page (depending on how youâ€™d like to design your site):
    Landing Page
    About (including the ability to download a PDF of your most current resume)
    Contact
3. Styling! You can either use Bootstrap or write all of the CSS yourself, depending on what you want to practice.
4. The site must be deployed so that anyone can access it on the Internet.
